# WyNDA-WMR
**Parameter Estimation for Wheeled Mobile Robots using WyNDA**

This repository provides MATLAB scripts for **parameter estimation of a Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR)** using the **WyNDA (Wide-Array of Nonlinear Dynamics Approximation)** framework.  
The implementation supports both **simulation-based analysis** and **experimental validation using real-world data**.

This repository is created to support our manuscript submission to **Systems Science & Control Engineering**.
